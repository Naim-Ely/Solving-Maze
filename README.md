# Solving-Maze
Solves mazes where walls are indicated by X's, the start is indicated by a + and the exit is indicated by a -.
Solves mazes in .dat files. 
You can chnage these values in the code pretty easily if you wish to do so.
I've included 3 sample mazes files, One large, one small and one that is impossible.
